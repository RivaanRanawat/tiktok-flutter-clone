        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
           match /{document=**} {
            allow read, write;
          }

      }
  ## Firbase Storage Rules
      rules_version = '2';
        service firebase.storage {
          match /b/{bucket}/o {
           match /{allPaths=**} {
             allow read, write;
          }
        }
